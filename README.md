# MAD_Project_Neighbourly
MAD project using Kotlin in Android studio (Neighbourly - App for solution ideas for Economic crisis) for SLIIT 2nd year 2nd semester project

Neighbourly is a mobile application built using Kotlin language aimed at reducing poverty in rural Sri Lanka and helping people in economic crises. The app connects volunteers and donors, where volunteers can sign up and provide their details, including their National Identity Card (NIC) for verification. Donors can donate money or items, such as food, school accessories, and medical items. Also, Donors can choose specific categories such as child orphanages, elder houses, low-income families, and low-facility schools for their fund donations. The donor dashboard displays the total fund amount, daily money donations, the donor's donations made in all time, as well as the donation overview for each category. Donors and volunteers can edit or delete their accounts.
The app also has a blog with a news page that offers awareness and information, where admin can post, edit, or delete articles. Volunteers can add selected low-income families in their area, and anyone can donate their remaining or prepared food for those families, reducing food wastage and hunger simultaneously. The system sends notifications to relevant volunteers to connect the donated food with those in need. The "Contact Us" page allows users to contact the team with any inquiries or concerns, and inquiries are directed to the relevant parties via email. Neighbourly provides a platform to make a positive impact on people's lives and communities in need.
Neighbourly plans to enhance the app's functionality by adding a volunteer delivery system for those who are unable to collect the available items. The app also aims to connect with the government health sector and register local officers such as Public Health Inspectors (PHI) to obtain key info about people in a given area, such as their BMI values, number of children, and monthly income, in order to prioritize the areas that require the most help and support.
Neighbourly is a non-profit app that supports its operations through advertising from item sellers, pharmacies, food cities, restaurants, and shops. With its noble purpose and innovative features, Neighbourly has the potential to make a significant impact on poverty reduction and create a more equitable and inclusive society in Sri Lanka.
